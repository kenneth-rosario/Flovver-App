## Project Proposal: _Flovver – Period Tracker and Ovulation Calendar_

**Current Situation:** The current situation is that, given that women have their menstrual and/or ovulation cycles, it is not always easy to track and/or communicate these cycles.

**Need:** There is a need to facilitate tracking menstrual and ovulation cycles and a way to communicate this information easily.

**Ideas:** The idea is to create an application that will help women track their menstrual and ovulation cycles and allow the user to share these cycles with the people they select.

**Concepts:** In a more specific way, the user will input their menstrual cycle data and by a series of calculations with previous data, the application will proceed to return approximation dates for their following cycles. As for the shareable aspect, the user will be able to share their cycle with people they select to sync their apps with.

**Scope:** The scope for this project is to implement an efficient menstrual cycle tracker, as well as an ovulation tracker. In addition to this, we plan on implementing a feature to share these cycles with the people the user wishes to do so with.

**Synopsis:** The project is to develop an application that allows users to track their menstrual and ovulation cycles, with approximated estimations of next cycles, and grant the user the ability to share this information with the people they select. Thus, the domain model is expected to cover subjects such as: 

1. Menstrual Cycles: tracking and estimation of the next cycle based on input data and biological usual pattern of the menstrual cycle; 
2. Irregular Cycles: adapting the estimations to cases in which the menstrual cycle deviates from a set pattern; 
3. Ovulation Periods: Estimate based on the cycle the periods in which the woman is more likely to get pregnant if the woman has sexual relations; 
4. Intercourse Tracking: keep track of the times the person is having sex and if the intent is to get pregnant or not; and so on.
